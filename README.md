<h1>Analysis View Dummy</h1>
This is primarily for testing the communication between the Python ML and the Analysis View page for Reme. Doesn't exactly follow the styling (as that is less important and handled by CSS anyway), and uses Bootstrap 5 for ease of editing the HTML side of things.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

- PHP version 7.1 or higher
